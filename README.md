# Code Snippet Storage ðŸ“˜

As the name suggests this is an app to store code snippets. 

This is the first electron/nodejs project that I've made. I created this app so I could quickly save code snippets and have them stored in an easy to access location.

- Save files to disk using the save file button

## Planned Features

- Improve the file explorer window by showing files in folders in a cascading view
- Support for creating and exploring folders through the file explorer

## Tech Specs

- The app is made using Angular 13, NodeJS, Electron 18, the Monaco Editor, and Bootstrap 5.
- The folder that is used to save and read files is <your user home directory>/Documents/code-snippet-storage.
- I chose the monaco editor for it's functionality and readability in formatting code snippets.
